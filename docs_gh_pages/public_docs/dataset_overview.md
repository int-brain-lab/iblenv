## Projects

### [2025 Decision-making accross mouse models of Autism (Noel)](../notebooks_external/2025_data_release_autism_noel)
Neuropixel recordings under the IBL decision-making tasks in mice harbouring mutations of _Fmr1, Cntnap2, Shank3B_.
The data is associated with the publication [A common computational and neural anomaly across mouse models of autism](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01965-8).

### [2022 Spike sorting benchmark recordings](../notebooks_external/data_release_spikesorting_benchmarks)
A list of 13 insertions in different brain regions to provide a smaller brain-wide Neuropixel benchmarks is available .

### [2020 Pilot neuropixels datasets](../notebooks_external/data_release_pilot)
The IBL has released a handful of pilot datasets that are available for download through ONE.
