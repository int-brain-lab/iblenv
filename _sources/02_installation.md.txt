## Unified Environment
To facilitate the use of `ibllib` and `IBL-pipeline`, we have compiled all the dependencies into a unified python 
environment `iblenv`. In addition to these two libraries, this environment is also compatible with other visualisation 
tools and analysis pipelines being developed as part of the IBL. 

To install this python environment and get started using the IBL data pipeline, please follow 
[these](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblenv) installation instructions.
